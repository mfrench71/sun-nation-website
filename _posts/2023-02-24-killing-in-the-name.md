"Killing in the Name" is a protest song by American rock band Rage Against the Machine, and appears on their 1992 self-titled debut album. It was released as the lead single from the album in November 1992. It features heavy drop-D guitar riffs, and lyrics inspired by the police brutality suffered by Rodney King and the subsequent 1992 Los Angeles riots.

"Killing in the Name" is Rage Against the Machine's signature song. In 1993, it reached number 25 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2009, following a campaign protesting the British talent show The X Factor, "Killing in the Name" reached the UK Christmas number one.

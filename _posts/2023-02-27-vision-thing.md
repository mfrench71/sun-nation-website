Panzer guitar riffs and blitzkrieg bass usher in this vicious, vitriolic examination of President Bush's America -- the first President Bush, that is, with his "million points of light" and, indeed, the "vision thing" that he mentioned in one of his speeches, to the howling delight of commentators and satirists everywhere. The then-imminent Gulf War, too, fired Eldritch's rage, mocking the presidential belief that the only solution to any problem was to send the army in to solve it. It was with some irony, one imagines, that an MTV video jock asked Eldritch whether he had any hopes of scoring an American hit with the song -- and some relish with which Eldritch replied that, if that had been his intention, it would've been an instrumental.

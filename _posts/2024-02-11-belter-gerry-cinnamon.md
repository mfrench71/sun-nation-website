Gerry Cinnamon, is a Scottish singer-songwriter known for singing with his native accent and having particularly 'honest' lyrics. With hits such as 'Sometimes' and 'Belter', Gerry has proved incredibly popular since his debut album back in 2017. In 2017, Gerry released his debut album 'Erratic Cinematic' which reached Number 17 on the UK Albums Chart and included the singles 'Belter' and 'Sometimes'. A couple of years after the album's release it became a Silver-selling album and Gerry celebrated the moment by posting on Instagram, 'No bad for a DIY record that only went into the shops last week. No label. No media. No problem. Just folk digging the tunes. That’s what it’s all about. That means it’s real.'

In 2007 Eddie Vedder wrote the soundtrack for Sean Penn’s movie Into the Wild. The movie is based on the life of adventurer Christopher McCandless. After graduating from university, McCandless decided to give up all of his possessions and adopt a nomadic lifestyle. McCandless longed for an authentic connection with nature, and as a consequence, decided to leave society behind. The most popular song on Eddie Vedder’s Into the Wild soundtrack is “Society”. The lyrically profound tune perfectly resembles the motives of Christopher McCandless.

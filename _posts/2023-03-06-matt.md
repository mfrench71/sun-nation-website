In secondary school, Matt began his journey with the guitar, but it wasn't until he teamed up with Stephen in the late 1980s that his interest turned into a serious pursuit. What began as bedroom practices soon transformed into full-volume rehearsals with Nick on drums, leading to the formation of _Rubber Love_.

While he briefly experimented with drumming, Matt dedicated over a decade to playing, performing, and recording with _Rubber Love_, which eventually became _Jester_ before disbanding naturally. After taking a break from music, Matt was invited to join _The Blast_, a Herefordshire-based classic-rock covers band. Between 2015 and 2021, Matt took another hiatus from music until a reunion to celebrate Stephen's 50th birthday brought him, Stephen, and Nick together once again. The trio decided it was time for a comeback, resulting in the formation of _Sun Nation_.

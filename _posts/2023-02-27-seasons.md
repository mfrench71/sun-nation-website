Chris Cornell was an American rock musician from Seattle, Washington. He began his career in 1984 when he co-founded the grunge band Soundgarden, and later performed with Temple of the Dog from 1990 to 1992. In 1992, Cornell released his first solo EP Poncier and contributed the song "Seasons" to the Singles soundtrack, which also featured the track "Birth Ritual" by Soundgarden. He also collaborated with Alice in Chains and Mark Arm (as "Alice Mudgarden") on "Right Turn" for the EP Sap. After Soundgarden split up in 1997, Cornell made a number of guest appearances for artists including Alice Cooper and Ramones, before releasing his debut solo album Euphoria Morning in 1999, which featured a number of songs co-written by Eleven members Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider. From 2001 to 2007, he worked with former Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk as part of Audioslave, who released three studio albums together.
